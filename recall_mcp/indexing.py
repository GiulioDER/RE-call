# Indexing budget caps (SECURITY.md "Indexing is client-callable and unbounded").
# `recall_index` is client-callable and, once past the RECALL_INDEX_ROOT confinement check below,
# had no ceiling on how much of that root it would walk, read and send to the embedder — with a
# paid embedder configured that is uncapped cloud spend per call. These two limits are enforced by
# `index_memory` BEFORE `Indexer.index_path` touches a single file: the candidate set is walked and
# measured first (`candidate_files` + `Path.stat`, no reads), and the whole request is refused if
# it exceeds either one. A cap that trips mid-walk, after some files are already embedded, is not a
# budget cap — it just makes the overspend partial instead of total.
#
# Defaults were chosen from this project's own real workloads, measured directly rather than
# guessed, so a legitimate `recall_index` call on any of them clears both limits with headroom:
#   - `make demo` indexes `corpus/`: 5 files, ~1.6 KB total.
#   - `recall code` indexes RE-call's own package (`recall/`): 30 files, ~242 KB total.
#   - The real eval corpus this project measures retrieval against (docs/CASE_STUDY.md,
#     re-measured for this change): 796 markdown memos, ~4.1 MB of content (5.6 MB on disk
#     including directory overhead).
# 2000 files / 20 MB give the largest of those (the 796-file, ~4-6 MB real corpus) roughly 2.5x
# headroom on file count and 3.5-5x headroom on bytes, while still refusing a client that points
# `recall_index` at something categorically bigger than a memory corpus — a vendored dependency
# tree, a build output directory, a whole home directory.

    `path` is confined to RECALL_INDEX_ROOT (default: the current working directory) so a client
    cannot read arbitrary files off the server's filesystem. Re-indexing REPLACES each file's
    chunks completely, so a shrunk file leaves no stale chunks behind.

    Before anything is read or embedded, the candidate file set is walked and measured against two
    budget caps — RECALL_INDEX_MAX_FILES and RECALL_INDEX_MAX_BYTES (defaults
    DEFAULT_MAX_INDEX_FILES / DEFAULT_MAX_INDEX_BYTES above) — and the whole request is refused if
    either is exceeded. See SECURITY.md's "Indexing is client-callable" gap for why this exists.

    `on_measured(files, bytes)` is invoked once those per-request caps pass and BEFORE anything is
    embedded, so a caller can meter aggregate spend against the set actually about to be indexed
    (the server debits the tenant's byte quota here). Raising from it aborts the request having
    spent nothing — which is the only reason the hook exists rather than the caller measuring the
    tree itself: a second walk is a second answer, and the one that bills must be the one that
    runs.
