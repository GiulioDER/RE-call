    - ``supersedes: project-recall-abstention-...-2026-07-18`` — no ``.md``, while the corpus

    Both targets existed. `recall lint` reported "does not exist in the corpus", which was
    actively misleading. A convention that the corpus's own author cannot follow is a defect in
    the convention: strip the wrapping and compare on the STEM, so `name`, `name.md`, `[name]`
    and `[[name]]` all mean the same document.

    Ambiguity handling is unchanged — two files sharing a stem are still refused rather than
    guessed at.
